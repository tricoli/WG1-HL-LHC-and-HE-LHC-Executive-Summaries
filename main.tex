(Bottom) The cross sections for high-mass supersymmetric particle production at $\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV, comparing the predictions of the PDF4LHC15 baseline with those of the HL-LHC PDF sets in the conservative (A) and optimistic (C) scenarios, normalised to the central value of PDF4LHC15. The results corresponding to gluino pair production (left) and squark-gluino production (right). Ref.~\cite{Khalek:2018mdn}}
